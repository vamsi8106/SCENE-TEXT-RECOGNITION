Finding Text In the Scene Images
In other words, OCR software converts a two-dimensional image of text—which could be handwritten or machine printed—into language that a computer can understand. To accomplish OCR as a procedure as accurately as feasible, it typically consists of multiple sub-processes. The subsequent steps are:

1.Preprocessing of the Image
2.Text Localization
3.Character Segmentation
4.Character Recognition
5.Post Processing
