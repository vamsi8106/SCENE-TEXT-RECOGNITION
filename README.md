Finding Text In the Scene Images
OCR (Optical Character Recognition): In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

Preprocessing of the Image
Text Localization
Character Segmentation
Character Recognition
Post Processing
